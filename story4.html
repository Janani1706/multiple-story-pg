      Ludo is a strategy board game for two to four players, in which the
      players race their four tokens from start to finish according to the rolls
      of a single die. Like other cross and circle games, Ludo is derived from
      the Indian game Pachisi. The game and its variations are popular in many
      countries and under various names.Special areas of the Ludo board are
      typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is
      assigned a colour and has four tokens[c] in their colour. The board is
      normally square with a cross-shaped playspace, with each arm of the cross
      having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle
      columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's
      home column. A sixth coloured square not on the home column is a player's
      starting square. At the centre of the board is a large finishing square,
      often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus
      depicting "arrows" pointing to the finish). Two, three, or four can play,
      without partnerships.[d] At the beginning of the game, each player's four
      tokens are out of play and staged in the player's yard (one of the large
      corner areas of the board in the player's colour). When able to, the
      players enter their tokens one per turn on their respective starting
      squares and proceed to race them clockwise around the board along the game
      track (the path of squares not part of any player's home column). When
      reaching the square below their home column, a player continues by moving
      tokens up the column to the finishing square. The rolls of a single
      die[6][7] control the swiftness of the tokens, and entry to the finishing
      square requires a precise roll from the player. The first to bring all
      their tokens to the finish wins the game. The others often continue to
      play to determine second-, third-, and fourth-place finishers.
