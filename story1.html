        Carrom is a tabletop game of Indian origin in which players flick discs,
        attempting to knock them to the corners of the board. The game is very
        popular in the Indian subcontinent, and is known by various names in
        different languages. In South Asia, many clubs and caf√©s hold regular
        tournaments. Carrom is very commonly played by families, including
        children, and at social functions. Different standards and rules exist
        in different areas. It became very popular in the United Kingdom and the
        Commonwealth during the early 20th century.The game is usually played on
        a square board made of plywood, with a pocket in each corner. The
        International Carrom Federation says that the square playing surface
        must be between exactly 73.5 and 74 centimetres (28.9 and 29.1 in) along
        each side, that the edges be bounded by bumpers of wood, and the
        underside of each pocket be covered by a net capable of holding at least
        10 carrom pieces.
